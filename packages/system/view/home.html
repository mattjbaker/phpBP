                This framework has been constructed from the top down by Matt Baker it combines MongoDB AngularJS and PHP. Its goal is to couple a backend platform on open source technologies with a modern client driven front end, while maintaining a flexible and easy to use architecture. The framework consists of three components: 
                <br>
                1). A stateless RESTFUL API with dynamic routing and token authentication
                <br>
                written in PHP with minimal code to power operations on the data layer (future versions to support MYSQL )
                <br>2). A simple feature-rich aggregation component<br>
                written in PHP to power the view layer, implement code optimization, and provide access to front-end libraries. 
                <br>3). An AngularJs front end MVC for powerful client-driven 'single page app' behavior
