         This engine was constructed from the ground up by Matt Baker and is built on a hybrid concept
    it combines MongoDB AngularJS and a PHP REST API. It's goal is to couple a backend platform
    based on traditional and "tested" technologies with a modern client driven front end, and to bypass
    the dependency on nodeJS or its sometimes excessive and often depreciated middlewares employed in the "MEAN" stack. Or similar modern frameworks
    keeping the system simple, lightweight, portable, and easy to use is the goal behind this project. These and many more 
    positive factors utilized in this rapid deployment framework un-officially dubbed "MAP"  make for a flexible architecture that will surely
    compete with the functionality and extensibility of any rival modern system.<br>
