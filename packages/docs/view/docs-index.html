    ELEMENTARY 'STACK' COMPONENTS
    <ul>
        <li>Apache</li>
        <li>PHP</li>
        <li>Mongodb / ( I hope to implement a msyql option as well )</li>

    INTRODUCTION.<br>
    <p>
    The angularjs patterns are borrowed from
    around the web and heavily from projects like mean.js and mean.io. This project basically represents
    hours of research and planing to create a system that moves quickly through development
    and is flexible for many projects and many purposes. Package management is not limited 
    I have tried to leave as many avenues for package configuration open, while also providing the
    interface for a more strict package management system, at the developer's discretion. The site in its native state makes use of bower, and composer for various features
    however neither system is required for deployment. </p>
    
    LOAD ORDER AND SERVER CONFIGURATION<br>
    <ul>
        <li>Package managers (composer) "there is no dependency on composer for back end development or deployment".</li>
    </ul>
    
    The minimal installation for this site should include the angular packages.
    <ul>
        <li>system</li>
    <li>users</li>
    </ul>
    
    It is highly suggested that the Admin module be included as well.
    managing the front end of the site will prove difficult without the 
    features included. The Admin module provides a clean set of 
    front side interfaces for user management and system settings.
